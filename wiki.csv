answer,question
Genetic drift,Genetic drift is a random effect on biological populations. Its effect is to remove genetic variation from a population of living organisms.
Fungus,"A fungus (plural: fungi) is a kind of living organism: yeasts, moulds and mushrooms are types of fungi. The fungi are a separate kingdom of living things, different from animals and plants."
Venus,"Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet because it has a solid, rocky surface like other planets in the inner solar system. Astronomers have known Venus for thousands of years. The ancient Romans named it after their goddess Venus. Venus is the brightest thing in the night sky except for the Moon. It is sometimes called the morning star or the evening star as it is brightest just before the sun comes up in the morning, and just after the sun goes down in the evening. Venus comes closer to the Earth than any other planet does."
Seafloor spreading,"Seafloor spreading happens at the bottom of an ocean as tectonic plates move apart. The seafloor moves and carries continents with it. At ridges in the middle of oceans, new oceanic crust is created. "
Magnetic field,"The magnetic field is the area around a magnet in which there is magnetic force. Moving electric charges can make magnetic fields. Magnetic fields can usually be seen by magnetic flux lines. At all times the direction of the magnetic field is shown by the direction of the magnetic flux lines. The strength of a magnet has to do with the spaces between the magnetic flux lines. The closer the flux lines are to each other, the stronger the magnet is. The farther away they are, the weaker. The flux lines can be seen by placing iron filings over a magnet. The iron filings move and arrange into the lines. Magnetic fields give power to other particles that are touching the magnetic field."
2 (number),"2 (Two; ) is a number, numeral, and glyph.  It is the number after 1 and the number before 3. In Roman numerals, it is II."
DNA,"DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that contains the genetic code of organisms. This includes animals, plants, protists, archaea and bacteria."
Ammonia,Ammonia is a chemical. Its formula is NH3 (not to be confused with Ammonium that has a formula of NH4+). It is made from nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.
Black hole,"A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, including light, can escape. According to the general theory of relativity, it is the result of the curving of spacetime caused by a very dense mass."
Dune,"In physical geography, a dune is a hill of sand built by eolian processes. Dunes have different forms and sizes based on their interaction with the wind. A ""dune field"" is an area covered by many sand dunes."
Triangle,":For other meanings, such as the musical instrument that is also called a ""triangle"", see triangle (disambiguation)."
Echinoderm,"Echinoderms  are a successful phylum of marine animals. They include starfish, brittle stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and their relatives."
Halogen,"The halogens are chemical elements under the second-to-right column in the periodic table, also known as Group 17. The elements in the group are fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine, and ununseptium. Halogen literally means ""salt becomer"", but it is often cited to mean ""salt producer"". They are very reactive, so they are likely to join with other elements on the left side of the periodic table to make compounds. This is due to the fact that they are missing one electron. They are rarely found alone in nature, except astatine, which is not found in nature. Fluorine is the most reactive, while iodine is the least reactive. Astatine is very radioactive and hard to get."
Golgi apparatus,"The Golgi complex, also known as the Golgi apparatus or simply the Golgi, is a cytoplasmic organelle. It is found in eukaryote cells, as in animals, plants, and fungi."
Gravity,"Gravity, or gravitation, is one of the fundamental forces of the universe. In this article, we discuss it in three parts:"
Kidney,"Kidneys are two organs in the abdomen of vertebrates that are shaped like beans. They make urine (the yellow waste water that comes out of the urethra.) They are part of the urinary system. When medical professionals discuss the kidneys, they typically refer to the word renal. For example, renal failure is when the kidneys are sick and do not work."
Zinc,"Zinc, sometimes called spelter, is a chemical element. It is a transition metal, a group of metals. It is sometimes considered a post-transition metal. Its symbol on the periodic table is ""Zn"". Zinc is the 30th element on the periodic table, and has an atomic number of 30. Zinc has a mass number of 65.38. It contains 30 protons and 30 electrons. In total, 29 isotopes of zinc are known, and five of these occur in nature. Some isotopes are radioactive. Their half-lives are between 40 milliseconds for 57Zn and 5x1018 years for 70Zn."
Capacitance,Capacitance is the ability of a body to store electric charge. A common device to do such task is a capacitor. The SI unit for capacitance is farad.
Factorial,"n factorial (written n!) is the number we get when we multiply every number from 1 to n. If n is 0, n factorial is 1. n! is not defined for negative numbers.  However, the related gamma function is defined over the real and complex numbers (but the integers it is defined over are positive)."
Tropical cyclone,"A tropical cyclone is a circular air movement over the warm ocean waters in the warm part of Earth near the equator. Most tropical cyclones create strong winds and heavy rains. While some tropical cyclones stay out in the sea, others pass over land. This can be dangerous because they can cause a lot of damage."
Tay-Sachs disease,"Tay-Sachs disease (also called Tray-Sachs syndrome) is a genetically heritable disease which causes problems with the metabolism of fat. Infants usually die of pneumonia or other infections before reaching four years of age. The disease is very rare in the common population, but common in Jewish families. There is no known treatment for this disease, however there is a cheap blood test that helps prevent this disease."
Friction,Friction is a force that acts to stop the movement of two touching things. The energy lost to friction is turned into sound and heat. Two kinds of friction are static and kinetic. Static friction is when the friction is strong enough to stop movement between two objects. Kinetic friction is when the frictional force is not strong enough to stop all motion.
Proton,"A proton is part of an atom. They are found in the nucleus of an atom along with neutrons. The periodic table groups atoms according to how many protons they have. A single atom of hydrogen (the lightest kind of atom) is made up of an electron moving around a proton. Most of the mass of this atom is in the proton, which is almost 2000 times heavier than the electron. Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of every other kind of atom. In any one element, the number of protons is always the same. An atom's atomic number is equal to the number of protons in that atom."
Electronegativity,"Electronegativity, symbol χ, is a chemical property that says how well an atom can attract electrons towards itself. The electronegativity of an atom is influenced by the atom's atomic number and the distance between the atom's valence electrons (the outermost electrons that take part in chemical bonding) and its nucleus. It was first theorised by Linus Pauling in 1932 as part of his valence bond theory, and is related to other chemical properties. Generally, electronegativity increases from the bottom-left to the upper-right of the periodic table; this is known as a periodic trend."
Coriolis effect,"The Coriolis effect is a force that is found in a rotating object. Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis first described the Coriolis effect in 1835 using mathematics. The Coriolis effect can best be seen in hurricanes. In the northern hemisphere, or part of the earth, they spin clockwise, in the southern hemisphere they spin the other way. This happens because the earth spins on its tilt."
Pi,"Pi or \pi is a mathematical constant, one of the first ever discovered. It is the ratio of the distance around a circle to the circle's diameter. This produces a number, and that number is always the same. However, the number is rather strange. The number starts 3.14159265... and continues without end. Such numbers are called irrational."
Red blood cell,"Red blood cells (also known as RBCs, red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes) are cells in the blood which transport oxygen. Red blood cells are very large in number; in women, there are 4.8 million red blood cells per microliter of blood. In men, there are 5.4 million red blood cells per microliter of blood. Red blood cells are red because they have haemoglobin in them."
Albert Einstein,"Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics)."
Avogadro constant,"The Avogadro constant (symbols: L, NA) is the number of particles (usually atoms or molecules) in one mole of a given substance. Its value is equal to . The constant was named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro."
Quartz,"Quartz is a very common type of mineral. You may hear other names when it has colors or looks different. Agate, Amethyst, Rose quartz are some names for quartz. It is a semi-precious gemstone."

Rene Descartes,"René Descartes (31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a famous French philosopher and physicist. He wrote books that are very important in the fields of maths, physics and especially philosophy. His dualism statement combined soul, mind, body theories, elements into one concept; a dualistic theory of mind and matter."
Electric charge,"Electric charge is a basic property of electrons, protons and other subatomic particles. Electrons are negatively charged while protons are positively charged. Things that are negatively charged and things that are positively charged pull on (attract) each other. This makes electrons and protons stick together to form atoms. Things that have the same charge push each other away (they repel each other). This is called the Law of Charges. It was discovered by Charles Augustin de Coulomb. The law that describes how strongly charges pull and push on each other is called Coulomb's Law."
Collagen,"Collagen is a group of naturally occurring proteins. In nature, it is found exclusively in animals, especially in the flesh and connective tissues of mammals."
Ferromagnetism,"Ferromagnetism is a property of many materials like iron. They are magnets, so they are attracted to, or pulled towards other magnets. In physics there are many different type of magnetism. Ferromagnetism is the strongest one. It is used every day in many technological objects, like television screens and credit cards."
Pulsar,"Pulsars are neutron stars which spin rapidly and produce huge electromagnetic radiation along a narrow beam. Neutron stars are very dense, and have short, regular spins. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that range from roughly milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. The pulse can only be seen if the Earth is close enough to the direction of the beam."
Kinetic energy,"Kinetic energy is the energy that an object has because of its motion. This energy can be converted into gravitational or electric potential energy, which is the energy that an object has because of its position in a gravitational or electric field."
Algae,"Algae (one alga, but several algae) are a type of plant-like living things that can make food from sunlight by photosynthesis. The study of algae is called phycology or algology."
Sorting algorithm,"An algorithm is a step-by-step list of directions that need to be followed to solve a problem. The instructions should be simple enough such that each step can be done without thinking about it. Algorithms are often used to describe how a computer might solve a problem. But there are algorithms in the real world too. A recipe can be considered a type of algorithm. It tells what ingredients are needed to make the dish and what steps to follow. If the recipe tells exactly what to do without too much confusion, then it is an algorithm."
Activation energy,The activation energy of a chemical reaction is the minimum energy that is needed to make the reaction happen. It usually has the symbol Ea and it is measured in kilojoule per mole. It can be thought of as a barrier between the reagents and the products of a reaction. The activation energy is the difference in energy between the transition state and the starting reagents.
X chromosome,The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in mammals. They decide the sex (gender) of an individual. The other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome.
Supernova,"A supernova is when a very big star explodes. This happens when a star stops making light and heat (hot), so it falls into itself (collapses), and after that explodes. The biggest of these stars we know of are called hypergiants and smaller ones are called supergiants. They are very big, and because of gravity they press on their centers very hard and use up their energy very quickly, so they normally only live for a few million years. After exploding, what is left becomes a black hole or a neutron star. But most stars are small and do not explode.  They become colder and smaller, and they become white dwarf stars."
Doppler effect,"Doppler effect is a change in frequency and wavelength of a wave. It is caused by the change in distance between the thing creating the wave (causer) and whatever is measuring (watcher or observer), seeing or hearing the wave."
Plasma (physics),"Plasma is a form (also called state) of matter. The three other common states of matter are solids, liquids and gases, so plasma is sometimes called the fourth state of matter. Plasma is created by adding energy to a gas so its atoms and molecules separate (called ionization) into negatively charged electrons, and positively charged ions. Unlike the other states of matter, the charged particles in a plasma will react strongly to electric and magnetic fields (i.e. electromagnetic fields). If a plasma loses heat, the ions will re-form into a gas."
Alan Turing,"Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (London, 23 June 1912 – Wilmslow, Cheshire, 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician and computer scientist. He was born in Maida Vale, London."
Meiosis,"Meiosis is a special type of cell division. Unlike mitosis, the way normal body cells divide, meiosis results in cells that only have half the usual number of chromosomes, one from each pair. For that reason, meiosis is often called reduction division. In the long run, meiosis increases genetic variation, in a way which will be explained later."
X-ray,"X-radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays are waves of X-radiation. X-rays have a shorter wavelength, and therefore more energy, than ultraviolet radiation. They have a much shorter wavelength than visible light (the light that we can see). Radiation with shorter wavelengths (more energy) than the X-ray is called Gamma radiation (γ-rays). These are all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum."
Electric current,An electric current is a flow of electric charge. The equation of current is:
Andromeda Galaxy,"The Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way, our galaxy. Andromeda is sometimes called M31 or NGC 324 by astronomers. It is about 2.6 million light years away from us."
Reduction (chemistry),Reduction is any chemical reaction that involves the gaining of electrons. It refers to the side that accepts electrons.
Volcano,"A volcano is a mountain where lava (hot, liquid rock) comes from a magma chamber under the ground."
Heat capacity,Heat capacity is a measure of how much materials can store up heat as they change temperature.
Alpha particle,"An alpha particle is made up of two protons and two neutrons. It is a kind of helium. Radioactive elements give out alpha particles when they go through a kind of radioactive decay, known as alpha decay."
Speciation,Speciation is about how species form. It is a major part of evolutionary biology.
Golden ratio,"If a person has one number a and another smaller number b, he can make the ratio of the two numbers by dividing them. Their ratio is a/b. He can make another ratio by adding the two numbers together a+b and dividing this by the larger number a. The new ratio is (a+b)/a. If these two ratios are equal to the same number, then that number is called the golden ratio. The Greek letter \varphi (phi) is usually used as the name for the golden ratio."
Center of mass,Image:CoG stable.svg|thumb|Diagram of an educational toy that balances on a point: the CM (C) settles below its support (P). Any object whose CM is below the fulcrum will not topple.
Matrix (mathematics),"In mathematics, a matrix (plural: matrices) is a rectangular table of cells of numbers, with rows and columns. The rows are each left-to-right (horizontal) lines, and the columns go top-to-bottom (vertical). The top-left cell is at row 1, column 1 (see diagram at right)."
Isaac Newton,{{Infobox_Person 
Euclid,"Euclid of Alexandria  (Greek: ) (about 325 BC–265 BC) was a Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt and worked at the Library of Alexandria. Little is known about this person, but people think he lived there when Ptolemy I was Pharaoh. It is not known where or when he was born."
Uranium,"Uranium is a chemical element (a metal) on the periodic table. It has an atomic number of 92, which means that a uranium atom has 92 protons in its center, which is called a nucleus. Uranium that is  dug out of the ground will be made from three different isotopes: three different types of uranium with different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei.  Most of it is Uranium-238; uranium-235 is less common; uranium-234 is the rarest.  Pitchblende is the main ore that is mined for uranium."
Ideal gas law,"The ideal gas law is the equation of a possible ideal gas, first made by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834."
Xylem,"The Oak (Marshall Ward) Fig 16.jpg|thumb|right|Xylem cells are long and narrow, like pipes, and they carry water"
Resistor,"A resistor limits the electrical current that flows through a circuit. Resistance is the restriction of current. In a resistor the energy of the electrons that pass through the resistor are changed to heat and/or light. For example, in a light bulb there is a resistor made of tungsten which converts the electrons into light."
Mars,"Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Solar System and the second-smallest solid planet. Mars is rocky and cold, with polar ice caps of frozen water and carbon dioxide. It has the largest volcano in the Solar System, and some very large impact craters. Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it is a red planet, the colour of blood."
Memory,"Memory is the personal record of past experiences. It is the brain's ability to store information to use later. It is studied in a special science called ""cognitive psychology"". There are three main types of memory:"
Sirius,"Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky. It is a binary star system in Canis Major, near Orion. It has an apparent magnitude of −1.46. The system is between 200 and  years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars."
Infinity,"Infinity is about things which never end. Sometimes, it is also written \infty. Infinity means many different things, depending on when it is used. The word is from a Latin word, which means ""without end"". Infinity goes on forever, so sometimes space, numbers, and other things are said to be 'infinite', because they never come to a stop."
Entropy,"Entropy is a law of nature in which everything slowly goes into disorder. The entropy of an object is a measure of the amount of information it takes to know the complete state of that object, atom by atom. The entropy is also a measure of the number of possible arrangements the atoms in a system can have. In this sense, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness. The higher the entropy of an object, the more uncertain we are about the states of the atoms making up that object because there are more states to decide from."
Pendulum,"A pendulum is a mass (any object, usually metal) on an arm. The arm is attached to a pivot, which is a point to swing from. The mass will naturally hang down because of gravity, but if it is pushed to one side it will oscillate, which means that it will swing from side to side.  The frequency of the swinging pendulum stays the same."
Eye,"The eye is a round organ for sensing light so animals can see. About 97 percent of animals have eyes.  Image-resolving eyes are present in cnidaria, molluscs, chordates, annelids and arthropods."
PH,pH (potential of hydrogen) is a scale of acidity from 0 to 14. It tells how acidic or alkaline a substance is. 
Chromatography,"Chromatography is a method using mixed substances that depends on the speed at which they move through special media, or chemical substances. It consists of a stationary phase (a solid) and a mobile phase (a liquid or a gas). The mobile phase flows through the stationary phase. Chromatography is much used in biochemistry and analytical chemistry."
Calcium,"Calcium is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table (a list of all the elements) is Ca. Its atomic number is 20. (The atomic number says where Calcium sits in the periodic table.) It has 20 protons and 20 electrons (if is an atom, see ion). The most common isotopes are Ca-40 and Ca-44. Its mass number is about 40.08."
Ozone,{{Chembox
Plate tectonics,Plate tectonics  is a theory of geology. It has been developed to explain large scale motions of the Earth's lithosphere. This theory builds on older ideas of continental drift and seafloor spreading.
Bernoulli's principle,"Bernoulli's principle is a concept of fluid dynamics. It says that when an incompressible fluid moves through different sizes of tube, the fluid's speed changes. This change in velocity is called ""acceleration"". Newton showed that acceleration only occurs through the action of a force. When a force acts over an area, it is called ""pressure"". So any change in a fluid's speed must be matched by a change in pressure (force). Bernoulli saw that while the speed of the flow went up in the larger part of the tube, the pressure went down in the smaller part of tube."
Integral,"In calculus, an integral is the space under a graph of an equation (sometimes said as ""the area under a curve""). An integral is the reverse of a derivative. A derivative is the steepness (or ""slope""), as the rate of change, of a curve. The word ""integral"" can also be used as an adjective meaning ""related to integers""."
Diffusion,Diffusion is the chemical & biological process when molecules from a material move from an area of high concentration (where there are lots of molecules) to an area of low concentration (where there are fewer molecules).
Limestone,"Limestone is a sedimentary rock, made up mostly of the mineral calcite, a form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3."
Insulin,Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas in the body that controls the glucose level in the blood.
Nuclear fusion,Nuclear fusion is the process of making a single heavy nucleus (part of an atom) from two lighter nuclei. This process is called a nuclear reaction. It releases a large amount of energy. 
Linus Pauling,"Linus Carl Pauling (February 28, 1901 – August 19, 1994) was an American scientist, peace activist, author and educator. He was one of the most important chemists in history."
Fault (geology),"A fault is a fracture, or break, in the Earth's crust (lithosphere). Some faults are active. Here, sections of rock move past each other. This sometimes makes earthquakes."
Velocity,"Velocity is a measure of how fast something has moved in a particular direction.  In physics, velocity means the time it took an object to move from one place to another (displacement), and the direction of movement - this is known as a vector quantity. An object could travel at 7 metres per second in a direction of 30 degress south of east. This is velocity."
Adenosine triphosphate,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide used in cells as a coenzyme. It is often called the ""molecular unit of currency"": ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism."
Benjamin Franklin,"Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 – April 17, 1790) was an American statesman. He has also been known as ""the First American"". He was a very important person in the American Revolution and helped make the Thirteen Colonies one nation. As a leader of the Enlightenment, he influenced European scientists. He even was the first thing many Europeans associated with America at the time. His successful diplomacy in France was an important factor in the United States' victory over Great Britain."
Fractal,"A fractal is any equation or pattern, that when seen as an image, produces a picture, which can be zoomed into infinity and will still produce the same picture. It can be cut into parts which look quite like a smaller version of the set that was started with. The word fractal was made by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975 from the Latin word fractus, which means ""broken"" or ""fractured"". A simple example is a tree that branches infinitely into smaller branches, and those branches into smaller branches and so on. Fractals are not only beautiful, but also have many practical applications."
Virus,A virus is a tiny parasite which can infect living organisms. It can replicate (copy itself) inside their cells. It is made only of a nucleic acid + a protein coat. Usually the nucleic acid is RNA; sometimes it is DNA.
Refraction,"Refraction is the change in direction of a wave, caused by the change in the wave's speed. Examples of waves include sound waves and light waves. Refraction is seen most often when a wave passes from one medium to a different medium. Different types of medium include air and water."
Photon,"Photons (from Greek φως, meaning light), in many atomic models in physics,  are particles which transmit light. In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy."
Frequency,Frequency is how often an event repeats itself over a set amount of time.
Glacier,"A glacier is a large body of ice and snow. A glacier forms because the snow in an area does not all melt in summer. Each winter, more snow is added. The weight of all the snow creates pressure. This pressure turns the lower parts of the snow into ice. After this happens for many years, the glacier will start growing very large. It becomes so heavy that gravity causes the ice to move. It flows downwards like water but very slowly. A glacier only moves about  per year. New snowfalls replace the parts that flow away. Glaciers are the largest sources of fresh water on Earth. The largest bodies of salt water are the oceans."
Bee,"Bees are flying insects of the Order Hymenoptera, which also includes ants, wasps and sawflies. There are about 20,000 species of bees. Bees collect pollen from flowers. Bees can be found on all continents except Antarctica."
Distillation,"Distillation is a chemical process where a mixture made of two or more liquids (called ""components"") with different boiling points can be separated from each other. The mixture is heated until one of the components boils (turns to a vapor). The vapor is then fed into a condenser, which cools the vapour and changes it back into a liquid that is called distillate'."
Tornado,"A tornado is a tube of violently spinning air that touches the ground. Wind inside the tornado spins fast, but the actual 'circle' of wind around them is huge. This makes tornadoes very dangerous. Tornadoes are especially dangerous to people in cars or mobile homes and about 60people are killed by tornadoes every year."
Electric field,"An electric field is a vector field that shows the direction that a positively charged particle will move when placed in the field. Electric fields are produced around objects that have electrical charge, or by a magnetic field that changes with time. Electric field lines are used to represent the influence of electric field.  The idea of an electric field was first made by Michael Faraday."
Orion (constellation),Orion is one of the largest constellations in the sky. It is supposed to look like the warrior Orion from Greek mythology. The constellation has other names in different cultures: it is mentioned under a Hebrew name in the Book of Job.
Uncertainty principle,"The Uncertainty principle is also called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Werner Heisenberg stumbled on a secret of the universe: No thing has a definite position, a definite trajectory, or a definite momentum. Trying to pin a thing down to one definite position will make its momentum less well pinned down, and vice-versa. In everyday life we can successfully measure the position of an automobile at a definite time and then measure its direction and speed (assuming it is coasting along at a steady rate) in the next few moments. That is because the uncertainties in position and velocity are so small that we could not detect them. We assume, quite correctly, that the trajectory of the automobile will not be noticeably changed when we drop a marker on the ground and click a stopwatch at the same time to note the car's position in time and space."
Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD)  is a brain disease that slowly destroys brain cells. As of now, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. With time, the different symptoms of  the disease become more marked. Many people die because of Alzheimer's disease. The disease affects different parts of the brain but has its worst effects on the areas of the brain that control memory, language, and thinking skills. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of senile dementia accounting for up to 70% of cases."
Gibbs free energy,Gibbs free energy is the available energy in a chemical reaction. It was calculated by Josiah Willard Gibbs.
Isomer,"An isomer in chemistry is a chemical that has the same molecular formula as another, but it has a different arrangement of atoms in space. Different isomers have different chemical properties (that is, they may look, or smell, or taste different from each other)."
Momentum,"Momentum can be considered the ""power"" when an object is moving, meaning how much force it can have on another object.  For example, a bowling ball (large mass) pushed very slowly (low velocity) can hit a glass door and not break it, while a baseball (small mass) can be thrown fast (high velocity) and break the same window.  The baseball has a larger momentum than the bowling ball. Because momentum is the product of the mass and the velocity of an object, that both mass and velocity affect the momentum of an object. As shown, an object with a large mass and low velocity can have the same momentum as an object with a small mass and large velocity. A bullet is another example where the momentum is very-very high, due to the extraordinary velocity. Another beautiful example where very low-velocities cause greater momentum is the push of Indian subcontinent towards the rest of Asia, causing serious damages, such as earth quakes in the portions of himalayas. In this example, the subcontinent is moving as slow as few inches per second but the mass (imagine weight of India) of Indian-subcontinent is very high."
Neuron,A neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is a cell that carries electrical impulses. Neurons are the basic units of the nervous system and its most important part is the brain.
Mean,"In mathematics and statistics, the mean is another name for the average."
Inner core,"The inner core is the very center of the Earth, and the hottest part of the planet. It is a mainly a solid ball with a radius of about , according to seismological studies. It is believed to consist mostly of an iron–nickel alloy and to be about the same temperature as the surface of the Sun: about 5700 K (5400 °C)."
Nuclear fission,"Nuclear fission is a nuclear process. It is when an atom splits apart into smaller atoms. The process gives off a lot of energy, and is used in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Nuclear fission was discovered in December 1938 by the German nuclear chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann in Berlin."
Gross domestic product,"In economics, the gross domestic product (GDP) is how much a place produces in some amount of time. For nations, the GDP can be calculated by adding up its output inside the borders of that country. To know the GDP of a country, you need to add up consumer spending, investment spending, government spending and the value of the exports and subtract the value of the imports."
Leonhard Euler,"Leonhard Euler (pronounced Oiler) (April 15, 1707 – September 7, 1783) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist. He spent most of his life in Russia and Germany."
Nitrogen,Nitrogen is a nonmetal chemical element. The atmosphere contains more than 78 percent of nitrogen. It has the chemical symbol N and atomic number 7. Its stable inside typically contains 14 nucleons (7 protons and 7 neutrons). It has 5 electrons in its outer shell.
Mass,"The mass of an object is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration, sometimes also called ""inertia"". A mountain has typically more mass than a rock, for instance. Mass should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of weight. A large mass like the Earth will attract a small mass like a human being with enough force to keep the human being from floating away. ""Mass attraction"" is another word for gravity."
Soil,"Soil (sometimes called dirt) is the combination of rock, mineral fragments (pieces), organic matter (dead and living things), water and air."
Electron,An electron is a very small piece of matter and energy. Its symbol is e−.
Convection,Convection is the movement of a physical quantity (for example heat) because of the movement of the matter.

Cell nucleus,"A cell nucleus (plural: cell nuclei) is the part of the cell which contains the genetic code, the DNA. The nucleus is small and round, and it works as the cell's control center. It contains chromosomes which house the DNA. The human body contains billions of cells, most of which have a nucleus. All eukaryote organisms have nuclei in their cells, even the many eukaryotes that are single-celled. Bacteria and Archaea, which are prokaryotes, are single-celled organisms of quite a different type and do not have nuclei. Cell nuclei were first found by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in the 17th century."
Viscosity,"Viscosity is a physical property of fluids. It shows resistance to flow. In a simple example, water has a low viscosity, as it is 'thin'. Syrup or tar, on the other hand has a high viscosity, as it is 'thick'. A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope. Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, whereas water would be a lot quicker."
Liver,The liver is an organ in the abdomen. It is part of the gastrointestinal system. Sometimes people use hepar- or hepat- as a prefix when they talk about the liver.
Prime number,"A composite number is a natural number of a particular kind. Any natural number is equal to 1 times itself. If the number is equal to any other numbers multiplied, then the number is a composite number. The smallest composite number is 4, because 2 x 2 = 4. 1 is not a composite number. Every other number is a prime number. The prime numbers are the numbers other than 1 which are not equal to m x n (except 1 x itself). The smallest prime number is 2. There is no largest prime number. The next smallest prime numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on."

Neutron,"Neutrons, with protons and electrons, make up an atom. Neutrons and protons are found in the nucleus of an atom. Unlike protons, which have a positive charge, or electrons, which have a negative charge, neutrons have zero charge which means they are  neutral particles. Neutrons bind with protons with the residual strong force."
Fundamental theorem of algebra,"The fundamental theorem of algebra is a proven fact about polynomials, sums of multiples of integer powers of one variable. It is based on mathematical analysis, the study of real numbers and limits. It was first proven by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.

Most of the muscles that animals can control on purpose are inactive. Animals that are asleep do not react to stimuli as fast as those that are awake. They can wake up from sleep more easily than from hibernation or coma. All mammals and birds, and many reptiles, amphibians, and fish, sleep. In humans, other mammals, and most other animals that were studied, sleeping regularly is essential for survival."
Plane (geometry),:Plane can also refer to airplane.
Force,"In physics, force is a push or a pull that changes or tends to change the state of rest or uniform motion of an object or changes the direction or shape of an object.

Titan (moon),Titan (Ancient Greek: Τῑτάν) is one of Saturn's moons. It was found by Christiaan Huygens on 25 March 1655.
Polymer,"A polymer is a molecule, made from joining together many small molecules called monomers.  The word ""polymer"" can be broken down into ""poly"" (meaning ""many"" in Greek) and ""mer"" (meaning ""unit"").  This shows how the chemical composition of a polymer consists of many smaller units (monomers) bonded together into a larger molecule.  A chemical reaction bonding monomers together to make a polymer is called polymerization."
Pressure,Pressure means how much something is pushing on something else.

Titration,Titration is a type of quantitative chemical analysis. It is used to work out the unknown concentration of a known substance.
Sublimation (phase transition),"Sublimation is the process by which a solid transforms into a gas without passing through the liquid stage. At normal atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth, only some compounds like 'dry ice' (solid carbon dioxide) can go through this process.  Most substances can only sublimate at lower pressure.  Many can sublimate in space."
Stratosphere,"The stratosphere is one of the layers of the atmosphere of the planet Earth. It extends from about 8 km above the poles (25 km above the equator) to about 50 km. In the stratosphere, the temperature rises with increasing height. This makes the stratosphere very stable. This temperature gradient is caused by the ozone layer which absorbs some UV radiation from sunlight. The absorbed radiation is converted to heat."
Georg Cantor,"Georg Cantor (born St Petersburg, Russia, 3 March 1845; died 6 January 1918 was an important German mathematician.  He founded set theory and worked on transfinite numbers."
Chloroplast,"Chloroplasts are small organelles inside the cells of plants and algae. They absorb light to make sugar in a process called photosynthesis. The sugar can be stored in the form of starch. Chloroplasts contain the molecule chlorophyll, which absorbs sunlight for photosynthesis. In addition to chlorophyll, a chloroplast uses carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) to form sugar, and gives off oxygen (O2). Chlorophyll is what gives green plants their green colour. Chloroplasts also contain various yellow and orange pigments to assist in photon capture for photosynthesis."
Svante Arrhenius,"Svante August Arrhenius (19 February 1859 – 2 October 1927) was a Nobel Prize-winning Swedish scientist who made discoveries in physics, chemistry and earth science."
Hash function,"The Hash function is a function. When a computer program is written, very often, large amounts of data need to be stored. These are normally stored in tables. In order to find the data again, some value is calculated. This is like when someone reads a book, and to remember, they put what they read into their own words. Hash values are much the same, except that care is taken that different sets of data do not get the same hash value (this is called a hash collision)."
Neutrino,"Neutrinos are a type of elementary particle that exist all across the universe. Physicists study these particles, but they are hard to find because they have a very small chance of interacting with regular matter. (For example, they pass through the whole earth without touching any other particles). Neutrinos travel near the speed of light."
Carl Friedrich Gauss,"Carl Friedrich Gauss (pronunciation: , Latin: Carolus Fridericus Gauss) (30 April 1777 – 23 February 1855) was a famous mathematician from Göttingen, Germany. Gauss contributed to many areas of learning. Most of his work was about number theory and astronomy."

Nebula,"A nebula  is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases in a galaxy."
Sodium,"Sodium (symbol Na, from the Latin name natrium) is the chemical element number 11 in the periodic table of elements. It follows that its nucleus includes 11 protons, and 11 electrons orbit around it (according to the simplified model known as ""Niels Bohr atom""). Even if a relatively large number of isotopes can be artificially produced, all decay in a short time. As a consequence all sodium found in nature (mainly in sea water) has the composition 11Na23, meaning that the nucleus includes 12 neutrons. The atomic mass of sodium is 22.9898; if it is rounded, it would be 23."
Isotope,"The atoms of a chemical element can exist in different types.  These are called isotopes.  They have the same number of protons (and electrons), but different numbers of neutrons. Different isotopes of the same element have different masses. Mass is the word for how much substance (or matter) something has. Things with different masses have different weights. Because different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons, they do not all weigh the same or have the same mass."
Haber process,The Haber process or the Haber-Bosch process is a chemical reaction that uses nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to create the chemical compound ammonia. The Haber process uses temperatures ranging from 400°C to 450°C under a pressure of 200 atm. The Haber process uses a catalyst mostly made up of iron.

Diffraction,"Diffraction is a physics concept.  Diffraction occurs when waves bend around small obstacles, or when waves spread out after they pass through small openings. Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as light that the eye can see. Diffraction also occurs with matter such as electrons."
Supersymmetry,"Supersymmetry is a theory (commonly found in some forms of string theory) that says that when the universe formed, there was also the same number of theoretical ""superparticles"" created. If this theory is true, it would at least double the number of known particles in the universe. Supersymmetry may create more than one copy, since there are many dimensions (M-Theory by Edward Witten predicts up to 11). Many scientists believe in supersymmetry because it solves many inconsistencies in the Standard Model of physics."
Compton scattering,"In physics, Compton scattering, or the Compton effect, is the name used for what happens to the energy (or frequency or wavelength) of an X-ray or gamma ray photon when it interacts with matter; the wavelength increases (or energy/frequency decreases) as it scatters off electrons. This scattering is one of the main things that happen when gamma rays meet matter. The Compton effect was studied by Arthur Holly Compton in 1923."
RNA interference,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a process in living cells. It adjusts (moderates) the activity of their genes. RNAi molecules are a key to gene regulation.

Elliptical galaxy,"An elliptical galaxy is a galaxy having an ellipsoidal shape, and a smooth, nearly featureless brightness profile. They are one of the three main types of galaxy originally described by Edwin Hubble in 1936. The others were spiral and lenticular galaxies."
Necrosis,"Necrosis is a medical condition in which parts of a person's body die, turn black, and fall off. This happens when the there is not enough blood reaching the tissues. This can happen for many reasons including injury, poisons, bacteria or radiation damage. The dead tissue will not grow back."
Gas chromatography,"Gas chromatography is a type of chromatography. The sample to be tested is first turned into a gas, and then carried through a column by a nonreactive 'carrier' gas such as helium or other inert gas such as nitrogen.  As the sample is carried through the column it is separated into its individual components.  To achieve this the column is housed inside an oven, where the temperature is controlled to allow the individual components to exit the column at different times."
Adsorption,"Adsorption is the sticking of atoms or molecules to a surface (called ""adsorbent""). The particles which get stuck on can be from a gas, liquid or a dissolved solid. An example would be the way water sticks to the surface of sand grains on a beach, or to particles of soil."
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,"Mad cow disease is the common name of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy. It's a disease that affects a cow's nervous system and their physical state. It comes from the chemistry structure of prion protein. When cattle get this disease, they have holes forming in their brains. The brain becomes spongy and begins to waste away. The cattle become very violent and show signs of mental disorder and have trouble when they move. It has a long incubation period, about 4~5 years. Cattle that are 4~5 years old can get the disease very easily."

Precession,"Stellar precession is the name for one of the ways the stars slowly move across the sky when seen from the Earth. The best-known thing this causes is making the north star's place in the sky slowly change over thousands of years. It is caused by the Sun's gravity pulling the Earth's poles toward itself. Because the Earth's poles are tilted at an angle of 23.42 degrees from straight up in relation to its orbit, this causes the North Pole to seem to point at different places in the sky."
Carbene,"A carbene is a molecule with a carbon atom that has two bonds and two other electrons that do not make any bonds. Since the carbon has only 6 electrons around it, it is quite reactive. The general formula can be written as  R-(C:)-R'."
Gluon,"Gluons are what hold quarks together to make bigger particles. Gluons carry the strong force between other quarks, so it is considered a force carrying particle. Photons do the same thing, but for the electromagnetic force. Also, like photons, gluons are spin-1 particles, and when a particle has spin-1 it is considered a boson."
Kirkwood gap,"Kirkwood gaps are areas of the asteroid belt where there are fewer asteroids than there would usually be, as seen in the graph on the right. They are caused by orbital resonances with Jupiter."
Surface tension,"Surface tension is an effect where the surface of a liquid is strong. The surface can hold up a weight, and the surface of a water droplet holds the droplet together, in a ball shape. Some small things can float on a surface because of surface tension, even though they normally couldn't float. Some insects (e.g. water striders) can run on the surface of water because of this. This property is caused by the molecules in the liquid being attracted to each other (cohesion), and is responsible for many of the behaviors of liquids."
Calcite,Image:Calcite-unit-cell-3D-vdW.png|thumb|The unit cell of calcite
Pernicious anemia,"Pernicious anemia is a medical problem that causes a person to have too few red blood cells (anemia) because their intestines cannot absorb vitamin B12 properly. A special protein, called intrinsic factor, helps the body get vitamin B12 from food such as meat, poultry and dairy foods. Intrinsic factor is made by cells in the stomach.  If there is not enough intrinsic factor, the small intestine is unable to get the vitamin B12."
Carbon dioxide,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a chemical compound. It is a gas at room temperature. It is made of one carbon and two oxygen atoms. People and animals release carbon dioxide when they breathe out. Also, every time something organic is burnt (or a fire is made), it makes carbon dioxide. Plants use carbon dioxide to make food. This process is called photosynthesis. The properties of carbon dioxide were studied by the Scottish scientist Joseph Black in the 1750s."
Chaperone (protein),Molecular chaperones are proteins which help large molecules fold or unfold. Some help assemble or take apart other macromolecular structures. They do not occur in these structures when the structures go about their normal functions.

Iron,":This article is about iron the metal. For the tool called iron, see ironing."
Chemical potential,"Chemical potential energy is the energy stored up in substances due to their chemical bonds. It is energy that is stored in chemicals. One example of how this plays a part in real life is through plants. The plants make energy with chemical potential energy by the process of photosynthesis. Other organisms eat the plants to get energy and so on. Energy is passed from one organism to another. This is how chemical potential energy works in the environment. Another common example is the energy stored in gasoline. When the car is turned on, the chemical energy in the gas is converted into mechanical energy to move the car. The law of conservation of energy says energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be changed from one form into another."
Birefringence,"Birefringence (or double refraction) happens when light is passed through a special material and it splits into two different rays of light. Calcite crystals and boron nitride are two good examples of materials that cause birefringence. Just as a prism splits light into a large number of colors, birefringence splits light into two images of the same color. You see this as a ""double image""."

Solar wind,"The Solar Wind is wind from the sun. It is a stream of charged protons and electrons and plasma shot out of the Sun. The wind is shot out at hypersonic speed, so fast that it can travel the whole length of the Solar System, nearly 1 light year and create the Heliosphere. The particles are dangerous to astronauts and spacecraft. The Earth's magnetic field absorbs or soaks up a lot of the solar wind causing the aurora, the Northern lights and Southern lights."
Centromere,"The centromere is a special region of a chromosome, usually near the middle. It is where the two identical sister chromatids stay in contact as the chromosome attaches to the spindle in mitosis. The region contains specific types of DNA, which are tandem repetitive sequences (satellite DNA). These sequences bind specific proteins called ""cen""-proteins."
Pointer (computer programming),"In computer science, a pointer is a variable whose value is a location in the computer's memory. If Rick stands in a room and points to his friend Sally, then Rick is a pointer whose value is Sally's location.  A programmer must dereference the pointer to retrieve the object it points to."
Field (mathematics),"In mathematics a field is a certain kind of algebraic structure. In a field you can add (x+y), subtract (x-y), multiply (x\cdot y) and divide (x/y) two numbers (with division only allowed if y is not equal to zero). A field is a special ring, in which you can divide."

He is well known as the inventor of chemical cells."
Polymerization,"Polymerization is the process in which small molecules, called monomers, join chemically to produce a very large chain-like or network molecules, called a polymer. The monomer molecules may all be alike, or they may represent two, three, or more different compounds. Usually at least 100 monomer molecules must be combined to make a product that has certain unique physical properties—such as elasticity, high tensile strength, or the ability to form fibres—that differentiate polymers from substances composed of smaller and simpler molecules. Often, many thousands of monomer units are incorporated in a single molecule of a polymer. The formation of stable covalent chemical bonds between the monomers sets polymerization apart from other processes, such as crystallization, in which large numbers of molecules aggregate under the influence of weak intermolecular forces."
Diatom,"Diatoms (Greek: dia = through +  temnein = to cut: ""cut through"") are a big group of eukaryotic algae. They are one of the most common types of phytoplankton. Most diatoms are unicellular, although some form chains or simple colonies. Diatom cells are encased within a unique cell wall made of silica (SiO2). These walls, called frustules, take many forms, some quite beautiful and ornate. They usually consist of two asymmetrical sides with a split between them, which gives the group its name."
7 (number),"The number seven is a natural number that comes after six and before eight. In Roman numerals, it is VII."
Gamma-Aminobutyric acid,"GABA is gamma-Aminobutyric acid (γ-Aminobutyric acid). It is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals. It is an inhibiting neurotransmitter. Normally, when a neuron receives an impulse, it will make the signal stronger. In the case where there is an inhibiting neurotransmitter, the cell will no longer get the impulse, and the signal as a whole will be weakened."
Luminosity,Luminosity is a measure of brightness.  Brightness is how much light is given off.
Sponge,"A sponge is a member of the phylum Porifera. It is a simple animal with many cells, but no mouth, muscles, heart or brain.

Serotonin can mainly be found in the gastroinstestinal tract, platelets and central nervous system of certain animals including humans. Its name is derived from its effect on blood pressure: serotonin is a part of the serum which regulates the tonus of blood vessels. Serotonin also contributes to the feeling of well-being. For this reason it is often labeled happiness hormone, even though it is not a hormone. Serotonin is a monoamine."
Ohm's law,"Ohm's law says that in an electrical circuit, the current passing through a resistor between two points, is related to the voltage difference between the two points, and inversely related to the electrical resistance between the two points.

Bubble sort,Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It is very simple for understanding and realization; therefore it is considered as a training algorithm. In real applications it is not used since it is not efficient.
Apoptosis,"Apoptosis is the controlled death of a cell. It plays an integral part of tissue development.  During limb development in a foetus, apoptosis allows body digits (fingers and toes) to separate from each other. The process is most prevalent until puberty begins. The rate of apoptosis should be balanced by the rate of cell production via mitosis."
Second law of thermodynamics,"The second law of thermodynamics states that whenever energy is transformed from one form to another form, entropy increases  and energy decreases. In other words: over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and density tend to even out in a horizontal plane, but not in a vertical plane due to the force of gravity.  For example, density and pressure do not even out in a vertical plane, and nor does temperature because gravity acts on individual molecules, and this means molecular kinetic energy interchanges with gravitational potential energy in free path motion between collisions."

Ester,An ester is a carbonyl with an ether group on the carbon atom. The group can be written as COOR. They can be made by reacting a carboxylic acid with an alcohol with some acid.
Vasopressin,"Vasopressin (ADH, AVP) is the hormone which controls the production of urine in the bladder. It is secreted by the pituitary gland based on the salt concentration of the blood. It is negative feedback: the more concentrated the salt in the blood is, the more vasopressin is secreted, which in turn makes the kidney tubules more permeable, allowing more water to be reabsorbed into the blood and creating less, but more concentrated, urine. It also triggers feelings of thirst."
Hemoglobin,"Hemoglobin (also spelled haemoglobin) is a protein in the blood which contains iron and is used to transport oxygen around the human body. Hemoglobin is found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates apart from white-blooded fish. Because hemoglobin is red, red blood cells are red.

Steels are often iron alloys with between 0.02% and 1.7% percent carbon by weight. Alloys with more carbon than this are known as cast iron. Steel is different from wrought iron, that has little or no carbon. There are some newer steels in which carbon is replaced with other alloying materials."
Jupiter,"Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is the fifth planet from the Sun. Jupiter is classified as a gas giant, both because it is so large and due to the fact that it is made up mostly of gas. The other gas giants are Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune."
Water,"Water is the most common liquid on Earth. It covers about 71.4% of the Earth. Pure water has no smell, taste, or color. Lakes, oceans, and rivers are made of water. Rain is water that falls from clouds in the sky. If water gets very cold (below 0 degrees Celsius), it freezes and becomes ice. Frozen rain is hail. Snow is formed from water vapour, not rain. If water gets very hot (above 100 degrees Celsius), it boils and becomes steam. Water is very important for life. However, some studies suggest that by 2025 more than half of the people around the world will not have enough water."
Earth,"Earth is the planet we live on. It is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to have life on it. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars."

Angular momentum,The angular momentum (L) of an object rotating about an axis is the product of its moment of inertia and its angular velocity:
Mercury (planet),"Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is the closest planet to the sun. It makes one trip around the Sun once every 87.969 days. Mercury is bright when it is visible from Earth, ranging from −2.0 to 5.5 in apparent magnitude. It cannot be easily seen as it is usually too close to the Sun. Because Mercury is normally lost in the glare of the Sun (except during a solar eclipse), Mercury can only be seen in the morning or evening twilight."
Temperature,"Temperature is how hot or cold a thing is. Our bodies can feel the difference between something which is hot and something which is cold. To measure temperature more accurately, a thermometer can be used. Thermometers use a temperature scale to record how hot or cold something is. The scale most often used is in degrees Celsius (°C), sometimes called centigrade. In the USA, degrees Fahrenheit (°F) are more often used while scientists mostly use kelvins (K) to measure temperature because it never goes below zero."

Laser,"A laser is a machine that makes an amplified, single-colour source of light. The beam of light from the laser does not get wider or weaker as most sources of light do.  It uses special gases or crystals to make the light with only a single color.  Then mirrors are used to amplify (make stronger) that colour of light and to make all the light travel in one direction, so it stays as a narrow beam, sometimes called a collimated beam. When pointed at something, this narrow beam makes a single point of light.  All of the energy of the light stays in that one narrow beam instead of spreading out like a flashlight (electric torch)."
Quark,"A quark is a tiny particle which makes up protons and neutrons. Atoms are made of neutrons, protons, and electrons. It was once thought that neutrons, protons and electrons were fundamental particles. Fundamental particles cannot be broken up into anything smaller. After the invention of the particle accelerator, it was discovered that electrons are fundamental particles, but neutrons and protons are not. Neutrons and protons are made up of quarks, which are held together by gluons."

Mutation,"In biology, a mutation is a change in the genetic material. This means changes to the DNA or to the chromosomes which carry the DNA. All such changes are heritable (can be passed on to the next generation) unless they have lethal effects."
Lambda calculus,"In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also λ-calculus, is a formal system. It was designed to investigate the definition of functions, and how to apply them. It is also a tool for analysing recursion. It was introduced by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s. Church used lambda calculus in 1936 to give a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem.  Lambda calculus can be used to define what a computable function is. No general algorithm can answer the question of whether two lambda calculus expressions are equivalent.  This was the first question, even before the halting problem, for which undecidability could be proved. Lambda calculus has greatly influenced functional programming languages,  such as LISP, ML and Haskell."
Standard deviation,"Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean), or expected value.

If they exist, they would not be point-like particles, but rather 1-dimensional ""strings"" of energy that vibrate in various dimensions. The image to the right illustrates the various possible dimensions that a string could vibrate in. (Currently, physicists accept the fact that there are at least 11 dimensions in our universe: 1 time dimension and 10 spacial dimensions.) The length of the strings would be determined by Planck length:"

Cystic fibrosis,"Cystic Fibrosis (also known as mucoviscidosis, CF, and 65 roses) is a condition a person may get from their parents. It causes the body to make thick, sticky mucus, which builds up in the lungs, the digestive system and other parts of the body. If both parents have the cystic-fibrosis gene, and pass it onto their child, the child will get cystic fibrosis. Only one gene is needed from each parent. The parent might not have cystic fibrosis but still might have the gene. A person with cystic fibrosis is not contagious (they can't give it to anyone else). There is no cure for cystic fibrosis but there are a lot of medications that help keep people healthy."
Enthalpy,Enthalpy is a concept used in science and engineering when heat and work need to be calculated.

It is called yellow because the skin sometimes becomes yellow, like it does with jaundice. There is a vaccine which can stop the disease, but many people in Africa and South America are not vaccinated against it. The World Health Organization say that 200,000 people are made ill with yellow fever every year, and that 30,000 people die from it. The diseases that spread from mosquito, or as widely disputed, rats, and also from an infected person through air, water, and food to a healthy person is called communicable disease. Yellow fever is a communicable disease, and it is highly contagious. It peaked in 1842, killing hundreds of people."
Osmotic pressure,"Osmosis is the movement of water through a plasma membrane from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high concentration. Osmosis is passive transport, meaning it does not require energy to be applied. What causes osmotic pressure is different concentrations of solutes on the two sides of the membrane."

Pion,"Pions (commonly shortened to a π) are a type of meson, which are subatomic particles made of a combination of quarks and antiquarks. Since antiquarks are antimatter, they will annihilate the same type (known as a flavour) of quark if they come near it. However, this reaction is not instantaneous, and so Pions, like all mesons, can exist for a short amount of time. What makes pions different from other mesons is that they are made of one up quark and one down quark, either of which can be the antiparticle. Pions are significant in science because they are thought to be responsible for the strong force interactions that occur between nucleons (protons or neutrons)."

They are a vital part of the adaptive immune system. They have a protein on the B cell's outer surface known as a 'B cell receptor'. This allows a B cell to bind to a specific antigen."
Atomic orbital,"Atomic orbitals are the places surrounding the nucleus of an atom where the electrons are most likely to be at any given time. It used to be believed that electrons behaved similarly to the solar system, where the nucleus is like the sun and the electrons orbit like the planets. However, electrons do not go in circles, they move in many different directions. The number of atomic orbitals in an element is defined by the period the element is in. Electrons move between orbitals depending on how fast they are moving and how many other electrons there are."
Chlorophyll,Chlorophyll is a chemical found in the chloroplasts of plants that allows the plant to absorb light. Energy from the light is used in photosynthesis to make glucose. This contains lots of stored energy which the plant needs to release. It does this through respiration. This energy is then used for lots of different things like growing or repairing damaged parts of the plant. Chlorophyll is also what gives the stem and leaf of the plant its green color.

Meson,"Mesons are incredibly small subatomic particles that are made of one quark and one antiquark. Antiquarks are the antimatter counterpart of a regular quark, meaning that in a fraction of a second, a quark and its antiquark will destroy each other to produce only energy. Since antimatter quarks have the opposite spin of regular quarks, their spins can cancel each other out, which forms a particle similar to a Higgs Boson. The name meson comes from Greek ""mesos"", meaning middle. This is because the masses of the first mesons discovered were between the mass of light particles like electrons, called leptons, and heavy particles like protons, called baryons."

A liquid crystal (LC) may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid crystal phases. Different phases are different because their optical properties are different. Using a microscope and a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will have different textures. This is also shown in the image."
Thiol,A thiol is a molecule that has a R–SH group. Thiols are like alcohols with an oxygen atom changed with a sulfur one. They have often a very strong and bad smell. Thiols are added to natural gas so that people can smell it. This is because methane does not have a smell but can explode very easily.

Random walk,A random walk is made by taking random steps.
Phosphorescence,"Phosphorescence is a process in which energy absorbed by a substance is released relatively slowly in the form of light. This is in some cases the mechanism used for ""glow-in-the-dark"" materials which are ""charged"" by exposure to light. Unlike the relatively swift reactions in a common fluorescent tube, phosphorescent materials used for these materials absorb the energy and ""store"" it for a longer time as the processes required to re-emit the light occur less often."
Diamagnetism,"Diamagnetism is a type of magnetism. They very weakly repel magnets. Most substances are diamagnetic. It was discovered in 1778 when someone saw that bismuth and antimony repelled a magnet. Diamagnetic things can be levitated. A frog was levitated in a very strong magnet. Water can be repelled by a magnet because it is diamagnetic. It is too weak to be noticed normally, though."
Third law of thermodynamics,The Third law of thermodynamics says:
Transition state,"In a chemical reaction, the transition state is the point where there is a maximum value of energy. This energy is called the activation energy. When two or more molecules are mixed, they will hit each other. If they hit with enough energy to go through the transition state, they will react and form new molecules. At the transition state, new bonds are formed while the old ones are broken. In a graph or a drawing, the transition state is often marked with the double dagger ‡ symbol."

Something that is quantized can be thought of as stairs; you can only move from step to step and you can't stand in between steps.  Something that is not quantized can be thought of as a ramp or smooth incline; you can move any distance up or down.  A lattice is the repeating or periodic structure of a crystal.  A crystal is made up of atoms or molecules in a certain pattern.  The points on the pattern at which the atoms or molecules are located is the lattice.  Solids, liquids, and gases can all experience vibrations.  A vibration being quantized means that only certain frequencies of vibrations are allowed."

Spherical fullerenes are also called buckyballs, and they resemble the balls used in association football. Cylindrical ones are called carbon nanotubes or buckytubes. They are usually made in the form of a hollow ball or tube. The fullerene was found in 1985 by Robert Curl, Harold Kroto and Richard Smalley at the University of Sussex and Rice University, and was named after Buckminster Fuller because his famous Geodesic domes are similar in shape."

Magnesium,"Magnesium ( /mæɡˈniːziəm/ mag-NEE-zee-əm) is a chemical element with the symbol Mg, atomic number 12 and common oxidation state +2. It is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, where it constitutes about 2% by mass, and ninth in the known universe as a whole. This preponderance of magnesium is related to the fact that it is easily built up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei). Magnesium ion's high solubility in water helps ensure that it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater."

Pumice,"Pumice is a term for a lightweight volcanic rock. It is a solidified frothy lava, created when highly-heated, pressured molten rock is shot out from a volcano. Its light weight is due to air spaces, which are caused by fast cooling and loss of pressure. The loss of pressure makes bubbles by lowering the boiling point of the lava (alike to the bubble-creation when a carbonated drink is opened). The  cooling then freezes the bubbles in the matrix.It is used for cleaning the skin of human beings ."

Derivative,"A derivative is something created from a Primary source, and can mean different things."
Laplace transform,"A Laplace transform is a way to turn functions into other functions in order to do certain calculations more easily.  This way of turning functions to other functions is very similar to U Substitution. The aim of this change is to be able to turn the hard work of integration into a simple algebraic addition and subtraction, just as logarithms allow us to add and subtract instead of multiplying and dividing. An example of its use is in Ruin Theory which is a subject of Actuarial Science with regards to insurance."
Graph (mathematics),"In graph theory a graph is used to represent the connection between two sets. One of the sets contains nodes (which are officially called vertices), the other one contains the connections (which are officially called edges). There are two classes of graphs, which are distinguished by the nature of the edges. Some edges can be travelled in both directions, other can only be travelled in one direction. Edges that can be travelled in one direction only are called directed, and the graph is called a directed graph or digraph. The ones which do not have a direction are called undirected, and the graph is called an undirected graph. If two vertices are connected by an edge, they are called adjacent."
Continuous function,"In mathematics a function is said to be continuous if, roughly said, a small change in the input only causes a small change in the output. If this is not the case, the function is said to be discontinuous.  Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an uninterrupted line (or curve). They can be drawn without lifting the pen. The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy."
Positron,"A positron is the antimatter version of an electron. It has the same mass and Spin (physics) as an electron, however it has a positive charge, whereas an electron has a negative charge. Like all antimatter, when it meets its so-called counterpartner, each are annihilated and turned into energy. The electron and positron disappear, and the total mass decreases. There is no name for this type of energy, as it is neither mechanical, radiation, chemical, electrical, nuclear, nor thermal.  Although the energy does emit light photons when annihilated, it is converted from some form of energy that has not been named."

He was a colleague of Robert Boyle and Christopher Wren, and a rival to Isaac Newton. Hooke was a leader in the plans to rebuild after the Great Fire of London in 1666."
CP violation,CP Violation is the way that nature breaks the laws that say that when you change a system by C symmetry or P symmetry then some descriptions of the system should stay the same before and after the change. The 'violation' is that they don't stay the same and the amounts are not conserved.  CP symmetry says that the laws of physics should act the same on a particle and on its antiparticle (Charge conjugation symmetry) and if it was also turned around like in a mirror (P symmetry.)

Exception handling,"In computing, an exception is a special situation where the program cannot do things the way it usually would and is forced to do something else instead. One layer of the system uses an exception to give another layer information about special states the system is currently in. The different layers of software or hardware have contracts, that tell what can be expected; this is generally known as Programming by Contract. In the context of exception handling, a program is said to be exception-safe, if exceptions that occur will not produce side-effects (such as memory leaks), will not change stored data so that it becomes unreadable, or generate output that is invalid. There are different levels of exception safety:"

Cells change their nature because mutations have occurred in their genes. All the daughter cells of cancer cells are also cancerous."
Sigmatropic reaction,"A sigmatropic reaction in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction. A sigmatropic reaction does not use a catalyst and involves a single molecule (an uncatalyzed intramolecular process). It changes one σ-bond into a different σ-bond. The name sigmatropic is the result of a compounding of the long-established ""sigma"" name for single carbon-carbon bonds and the Greek word tropos, meaning turn.  This is a rearrangement reaction which means that the bonds in a molecule shift between atoms without any atoms leaving or new atoms added to the molecule. In a sigmatropic reaction, a substituent moves from one part of a π-bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the π system. True sigmatropic reactions usually do not need a catalyst. Some sigmatropic reactions are catalyzed by a Lewis acid.  Sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions.  The most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the [3,3] Cope rearrangement, Claisen rearrangement, Carroll rearrangement and the Fischer indole synthesis."

A simple example of this dipole is a pair of electric charges with the same magnitude but with the opposite type of charge (positive and negative) and are separated by a small distance from each other. The second is a magnetic dipole, a closed circulation of electric current. A simple example is a single loop of wire with electric current flowing through it."
DDT,"DDT is a well-known pesticide. The abbreviation stands for Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane, one of its names. The Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Müller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1948, for his discovery. In the 1960s there was a study that questioned if it was good to spread large amounts of DDT indiscriminately. The study also found that DDT could cause cancer. DDT is also highly poisonous to birds and other animals further up the food chain. This is why DDT was replaced by other pesticides. The Stockholm Convention which took effect in 2004, restricts the use of DDT to vector control. The convention does not affect the use of DDT for public health issues. This is because there are very few affordable alternatives. DDT is still widely used in India, North Korea and possibly elsewhere."

The House of the Seven Gables,"The House of the Seven Gables is a novel written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was published in 1851. The book is about an old New England family. Themes include guilt, revenge, and atonement. The supernatural and witchcraft are a part of the story. An old house in Salem, Massachusetts was used as background for the story. The house belonged to Hawthorne's cousin Susanna Ingersoll. He visited the house often. He was also inspired by his ancestors. They played a part in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. The book was well received. The House of the Seven Gables has been adapted to movies and television shows."
Pepsin,"Pepsin is an enzyme. It acts on proteins in the stomach, which has a low pH because of the Hydrochloric acid. It works best at a pH of about 1.5. It will not work at a pH above 6."
Genetic linkage,Genetic linkage occurs when alleles at different loci do not segregate at random. Mendel's second law is thus broken.
Bamboo,"Bamboo is a name for over 1,400 species of giant grasses in 115 different genera. All bamboos have wood-like stems. Bamboo mainly grows in Africa, America and in Asia but can easily grow in Europe."
Small intestine,"The small intestine is an intestine, and a part of many living beings. It lies between the stomach and the large intestine. In humans over 5 years old, a small intestine may be five to six meters long. It is longer than the large intestine. But, as its diameter is less, its name is small intestine."
Sickle-cell disease,Sickle cell anaemia is a genetic disease. It affects red blood cells. It changes the cells from flexible disks into rigid crescents. When many red cells take this shape veins get blocked. This can cause damage to many organs. The organ damage increases with time and leads to an early death.
Young's modulus,Young's modulus is the measure of how much force is needed to stretch or compress a substance. Its most basic form is stress/strain. Stress is the measure of the force applied to a certain area. Strain is the amount by which the substance is deformed.

General relativity,"General relativity is a theory of space and time. The theory was published by Albert Einstein in 1915. The central idea of general relativity is that space and time are two aspects of spacetime. Spacetime is curved when there is gravity, matter, energy, and momentum. The links between these forces are shown in the Einstein field equations."
Calculus,"Calculus is a branch of mathematics which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a function. For example, if you had one formula telling how much money you got every day, calculus would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total, and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to.   All these formulas are  functions of time, and so that is one way to think of calculus -- studying functions of time. There are two different types of calculus. Differential calculus divides things into small (different) pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next, while integral calculus joins (integrates) the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made, overall, by a series of changes. Calculus is used in many different areas of study such as physics, astronomy, biology, engineering, economics, medicine and sociology."
Function (mathematics),"In mathematics, a function is a prescription that assigns to every object of one set an object of another (or the same) set. In many cases the objects are numbers. A function may be seen as producing an output - the assigned object -, when given an input - the object from the first set.  So a function is like a process. Each input x that is in the set X of inputs is paired with one output y in the set Y of outputs. The set X of inputs is called the domain and the set Y of possible outputs is called the codomain. Then it is said that y is a function of x, and we write y =f(x). f is the name of the function and one writes f:X \to Y  (function from X to Y) to represent the three parts of the function, the domain, the codomain and the pairing process."
Cyanide,"Cyanides are chemicals that contain the cyano-group. In that group a carbon atom has three chemical bonds to a nitrogen atom. This group is present in many substances. Many of them are gases, but some are solids or liquids. Those substances that can release the compound CN are highly poisonous."
Maize,Maize (called corn in some countries) is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is a cereal grain that was first grown by people in ancient Central America. It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world.
Phosphate,{{Chembox
Electron affinity,"Electron affinity is a phrase used in chemistry.  When an atom that is neutral gets an electron, the energy that is changed in the atom is the electron affinity. Across a period, the electron affinity increases."
Vitamin D,"Vitamin D is not actually a vitamin. It is a steroid hormone, which is made in the body under the right conditions. However, if the body does not make enough, it can also be obtained from food sources."
Absolute zero,"In theory, absolute zero is the temperature at which the particles of matter (molecules and atoms) are at their lowest energy points. It is a common misconception that at absolute zero particles lose all energy and stop moving. This, however, is false. In quantum physics there is something called zero point energy, which means that even after all the energy that can be extrapolated from particles is extrapolated, particles still have some energy. This is due to the Heisenberg Principle of Uncertainty, which states that the more you know about a particles position, the less you know about it's momentum, and vice versa. Therefore you cannot have a particle that is stopped, because then you would know both its exact position and momentum. In practice, it is impossible, because, much like reaching the speed of light, the amount of energy required is too vast. Some people have created temperatures very close to absolute zero: the record temperature was 100 pK (one hundred picokelvin, equal to 10−10 kelvin) above absolute zero. Even getting close to absolute zero is difficult because anything that touches an object being cooled near absolute zero would give heat to the objects. Scientists use lasers to slow atoms when cooling objects to very low temperatures."
Comet,"A comet is a ball of mostly ice that moves around in outer space. Comets are often described as ""dirty snowballs"".  They are very different from asteroids.  The orbital inclinations of comets are usually high and not near the ecliptic where most solar system objects are found. Most of them are long-period comets and go further than Pluto. Those are very far away from the Sun, but some comets come near enough to Earth for us to see at night."
Shark,":For the NHL team, see San Jose Sharks"
Anthrax,"Anthrax, or splenic fever is a disease. Both humans and other animals can get it. It is caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis. It is common with even-toed ungulates (some hoofed creatures, like camels and giraffes). The spores of the bacteria can live for hundreds of years. Humans usually catch the disease from animals. It is usually not passed from one human to another.  Anthrax can be treated with antibiotics. There is also a vaccine against it. If not treated, anthrax often leads to death."

Strange quark,"Strange quarks are the third lightest quarks, which are subatomic particles that are so small, they are believed to not be able to be divided. Like down quarks, strange quarks have a charge of -1/3. Like all fermions (which are particles that can not exist in the same place at the same time), strange quarks have a spin of 1/2. What makes strange quarks different from down quarks–apart from having 25 times the mass of down quarks–is that they have something that scientists call ""strangeness."" Strangeness is basically a resistance to decay against strong force and electromagnetism. This means that any particle that contains a strange quark can not decay due to strong force (or electromagnetism), but instead with the much slower weak force. It was believed that this was a 'strange' method of decay, which is why the scientists gave the particles that name."

Icebergs are especially common during spring, when ice has begun to melt. About 90% of an iceberg is below the water line and ten percent above. Just by looking at the part you can see, it is hard to tell how the part underwater looks, and how close you can get before crashing into it."
Parthenogenesis,Parthenogenesis is a term in biology. It means virgin birth. It is an asexual form of reproduction. Females lay eggs without fertilization by a male. Growth and development of embryos occurs with all genes inherited from the mother.
Bone,"Bones are parts of the human or animal skeleton of vertebrates. They are stiff organs which make up the endoskeleton. Our body is made of flesh and blood built on a framework of bones. Without our bones, we could not stand up or move about. They also protect organs inside our body. The skull protects the brain and the ribs protect the heart and lungs. The teeth support the facial muscles and help us smile. The number of bones in a human's neck is the same as a giraffe's."

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (August 27, 1770 – November 14, 1831) was a German philosopher born in Stuttgart, Württemberg, which is now southwest Germany. He started Hegelianism and is a part of German Idealism. He influenced many writers and philosophers, including those who agreed with him (Bradley, Sartre, Küng, Bauer, Stirner, Marx), and those who did not agree with him (Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Schelling). Hegel's books are difficult to read and deal with many different ideas at the same time. He has written about history, politics, religion, art, logic and metaphysics."
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (August 28, 1749 – March 22, 1832) was a German writer, poet, novelist, and playwright. He also worked as an actor, administrator, scientist, geologist, botanist and philosopher. He influenced many 19th century writers and thinkers. His contributions to science include his work in botany and his Theory of Colours. Famous lines from his books are often quoted, and some of his phrases have become part of the German language. His poems were set to music by composers like Schubert, Schumann, Brahms, Wolf, and Strauss. Most of his scientific work now seems old-fashioned."
Don Giovanni,Don Giovanni  is an Italian opera in two acts. It is about the character better known as Don Juan. The music was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Complex conjugate,"In algebra and calculus, the complex plane is the coordinate system in which complex numbers are graphed. The vertical axis is the imaginary axis, and the horizontal axis is the real axis. Basically, in the complex number of the form a+bi, (where the real part is a and the imaginary part is bi) you go a spaces on the real axis, and b spaces on the imaginary axis. The complex plane can also be expressed in the form of polar coordinates, in which the magnitude of the line is equal to the square root of a plus b, and the direction is a specified angle, as in normal polar coordinates."

The name is a combination of quetzalli, a brightly colored Mesoamerican bird, and , which means serpent; it is therefore usually translated as ""feathered serpent"" or ""plumed serpent"". Quetzalcoatl was often pictured as a snake with feathers, although he was sometimes shown in the form of a human. Quetzalcoatl was associated with the planet Venus, as well as being the patron god of the Aztec priesthood, of learning and of knowledge."

His name is often thought of together with that of Claude Debussy, but their music is really very different. Ravel liked children and animals and his music is often about them. He liked to write about fairy tales and stories from far away lands. He wrote some lovely piano music, most of which is difficult to play. Boléro is a 17 minute piece for orchestra. A short version was used by ice-skaters Torvill and Dean for the dance that made them Olympic champions in 1984."
Haemophilia,"Haemophilia is a blood condition that means bleeding does not stop. The bleeding occurs because the blood does not clot.

Lisp was designed by John McCarthy in 1958. The best-known versions of LISP are Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure. Many concepts that are used in modern programming languages were first created in Lisp."
George Boole,"George Boole [buːl], (November 2, 1815 – December 8, 1864) was an English mathematician and philosopher. He created Boolean algebra. This is one of the bases of modern-day computer science. Other people, like Augustus De Morgan and Charles Peirce, refined and completed his work. In their times, very few people knew of the work those mathematicians had done. Boolean algebra was rediscovered by Claude Shannon about 75 years after Boole's death. In his doctoral thesis, Shannon showed that boolean algebra was useful. It could simplify the design of electric switches and relays (like those that were used in the telephone switchboards of the time). Shannon also showed that such switches could solve boolean algebra problems. All modern-day digital circuits (mainly computers) use such algebra to solve problems. "
